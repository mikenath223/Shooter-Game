## Design
This game was designed using Phaser 3. It contains three group of files for Scenes (Main Game Scene, Game Over Scene and Leaderboard Scene). The main purpose of this file is to create characters, handle the the characters logic, save the score and manage the Game Over logic.

The rules of the game are: You . 

Once you lose in the game you get a chance to see the leaderboard and watch how wel you rank against other player:

Then you can click the submit button, or better, shoot with your mouse!

You get a list of players and their scores, a Leaderboard.
